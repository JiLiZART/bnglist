This covers the protocol used between the bnglist server and it's workers. These workers are used to update the gamelist, and may have extra functions in the extended protocol. Workers may or may not support all of these functions. No authentication is supported - an IP address whitelist can be used to only accept certain hosts, or if only connections from localhost will be made the server can bind to localhost.

By default, the server listens on port 5873.

W->S: PUSH mappath|hostname|ipstring|port|hostcounter|gametype|mapflags|mapwidth|mapheight|elapsedtime|crc|realm|gamename

	realm is the ID of the realm on the worker side (all workers should have the same realm config)
